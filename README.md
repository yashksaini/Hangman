## Introduction
Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game that challenges players to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. Players can choose from three categories: fruits, animals, and countries. The game presents a series of dashes representing the letters of the word, and players must guess one letter at a time. If a guessed letter matches any of the letters in the word, the corresponding dashes are replaced with the correct letter. However, if a guessed letter does not exist in the word, the game deducts one life (out of six) from the player. If the player runs out of lives before guessing the entire word, they lose the game. The objective is to guess the word correctly within the given attempts.
